This code snippet demonstrates a potential issue with PHP's type juggling and the behavior of the `==` operator.
```php
$a = 0;
$b = 'abc';

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a is equal to $b';
} else {
  echo '$a is not equal to $b';
}
```
In this example, the `==` operator performs a loose comparison, which means it attempts to convert the operands to a common type before comparison.  In this case, PHP converts the string 'abc' to an integer which becomes 0. Thus, the condition `$a == $b` evaluates to true and the first echo statement executes.

This behavior can lead to unexpected results if you're not careful about type handling.  Using strict comparison (`===`) prevents this issue, as it checks both the type and the value.

This is subtle and easily missed by developers who are unfamiliar with PHP's type handling nuances.  It leads to difficult-to-debug errors.
